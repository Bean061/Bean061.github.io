title: "*Nyssa sylvatica* species complex"
excerpt: "*Nyssa sylvatica* complex consists of several woody taxa occurring in eastern North America. These taxa were recognized as two or three species including three or four varieties by different authors. Due to high morphological similarities and complexity of morphological variation, classiﬁcation and delineation of taxa in the group have been difficult and controversial. Here we employ data from RAD-seq to elucidate the genetic structure and phylogenetic relationships within the group. Using the genetic evidence, we evaluate previous classiﬁcations and delineate species. Our results support the recognition of two species in the complex, *N. sylvatica* and *N. biﬂora*, following the phylogenetic species concept. We found no genetic evidence supporting recognitions of intraspeciﬁc taxa. However, we propose *subsp. ursina* and *subsp. biﬂora* within *N. biﬂora* due to their distinction in habits, distributions, and habitats.
