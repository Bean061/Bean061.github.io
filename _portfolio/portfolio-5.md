title: "*Castanea* and *Hamamelis*"
excerpt: "*Hamamelis* (the witch-hazels) and *Castanea* (chestnuts) are two classic examples exhibiting the well-known eastern Asian (EA)-eastern North American (ENA) disjunct distribution. Our results showed congruences in phylogenetic inference and divergence time dating between RAD-seq and Hyb-Seq data sets. Check out the details in our MPE paper. <br/><img src='/images/Castanea_Hamamelis.png'>"
