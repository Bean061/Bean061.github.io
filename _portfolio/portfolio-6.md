title: "*Torreya* phylogenomics"
excerpt: "*Torreya* is a classic example of the well‐known EA–NA floristic disjunction with species richness biased toward EA. The genus has seven extant species: two from NA and five from EA. In our study, we used Rad‐seq data in combination with plastome and mitochondrial gene sequences, morphology, and fossil records to reconstruct the phylogenetic and biogeographic histories of the genus and tested hypotheses on anomalies of biodiversity of the eastern Asian‐North American floristic disjunction. See details in my publication on JSE. <br/><img src='/images/Torreya_2.JPG'>"
