Welcome
======
I am a postdoctral research associate in Drs. Jones lab at UNC-Chapel Hill. I am intestested in plant evolutionary biology. Currently, I am working on grasses and rushes genomic comparison under different environments. 

My Ph.D. thesis was foucused on phylogenomics, molecular systematics, biogeography, and population genetics; with emphases on the disjunct plant taxa in eastern Asia and eastern North America.
